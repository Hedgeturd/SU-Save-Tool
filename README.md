# Sonic Unleashed Save Tool
A very simple tool to convert Unleashed HD Saves from one platform to another

## Usage
You can also simply drag and drop your saves onto the executable.

## Requirements
If the tool does nothing when used, you may need to install the [.NET Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win10-x64&apphost_version=8.0) package that the tool needs to work
